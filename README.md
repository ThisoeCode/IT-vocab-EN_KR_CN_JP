> ### Overview
> - This orphan branch is created just to test the Next.js `fetch()` function with `POST` or `PUT` method on Vercel deployment.
> - Getting "`RequestContentLengthMismatchError`" error logged at Vercel while hitting the `fetch()`.
> - Still trying to find the root problem. Not figuring it out yet. [Help!!ðŸ¥¹](https://youtu.be/50Ura_ZcSvY)



# About This Repo
- This is a simple Excel-like Next.js app. You can add and delete rows or modify cells. Columns are fixed and are defined in a config file before building.
- The frontend is sending `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `PATCH` to respectively load existing data, add a new row, delete a row, and modify a cell.
- The backend is made of two `route.js` API models.

> The current branch is an orphan branch that is only used to run a `fetch()` to `PUT`/`POST` a row of test data to the API.

# Problem Description

### Works on localhost but not on Vercel
I was working on branch [orphan-hanja](https://github.com/ThisoeCode/IT-vocab-EN_KR_CN_JP/tree/orphan-hanja).
After done building (`npm run build`) and testing on `localhost:3000`, I ran and used it on localhost for several days. Everything worked perfectly fine.

_**Then I deployed the branch with Vercel. `GET`, `DELETE`, and `PATCH` methods worked fine, but not for `PUT` and `POST`.**_ 
_([deployed project](https://hanja.thisoe.dev/))_
I got a `RequestContentLengthMismatchError` error with code `UND_ERR_REQ_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH` in the [error log](#error-log-from-vercel).

I thought the problem might be the `PUT` method, so I changed the fetch and API from `PUT` to `POST` (see [commit `ea9916e`](https://github.com/ThisoeCode/IT-vocab-EN_KR_CN_JP/commit/ea9916ec18525618bb0518eefcdcd1d484f7caff)). The same error popped up: `RequestContentLengthMismatchError`.

Here is the full error message trace stack.

### Test guide
1. Pull this branch and [`orphan-hanja`](https://github.com/ThisoeCode/IT-vocab-EN_KR_CN_JP/tree/orphan-hanja) branch;
2. Make sure to have an Atlas database Cluster, then fill out the `.env.FILLME` and rename it to `.env.local`;
3. Run command `npm i`, `npm build`, `npm start`;
4. Push and deploy on Vercel;
5. Getting the error.

- To check out the `PUT`ting result, build and run branch [`orphan-hanja`](https://github.com/ThisoeCode/IT-vocab-EN_KR_CN_JP/tree/orphan-hanja) (or visit [hanja.thisoe.dev](https://hanja.thisoe.dev/) using my Atlas database). There will be a line added at the top that says **TEST FROM \`vercel-put-test\`** with the UUID generated on each success fetch.


### Exclusions

- API normal
> Used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to check the API (https://hanja.thisoe.dev/serv), `PUT`ting new row successfully.

- `PUT` method?
> I also tried `POST` as replacement of `PUT` (see [commit `ea9916e`](https://github.com/ThisoeCode/IT-vocab-EN_KR_CN_JP/commit/ea9916ec18525618bb0518eefcdcd1d484f7caff)).

- `201` status code?
> I tried `200` or leaving out status option (see [commit `5a84503`](https://github.com/ThisoeCode/IT-vocab-EN_KR_CN_JP/commit/5a84503150139586abf5a4a1cd64c9bf16c82033)).
